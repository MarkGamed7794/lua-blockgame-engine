If you're just here for the engine, look no further than the entire /game/ directory. Everything outside of it, except for /funcs.lua, is not required for the engine to work.
If you use this engine, use /main.lua as a pseudo-reference.

As for copyright... well I don't know. Please use it; if you do, link the GitHub repo.
Documentation is in the engine files. Some stuff might be tied to the renderer and as such can be safely ignored.
